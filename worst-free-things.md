# The Worst Free Things
Everybody loves free thing. But free things are often just a scam, and can even download a virus. Here are some free things that are known to be scams.

## Websites
### Domains

.tk, .ga, .cf, .gq and .ml domains: They are free, but expire after a year and have been known to be down often

### Hosting

000webhost.com and hosting24.com: Hosting is up 60% of the time or less, and 12-year-old PCs run code faster than their servers
