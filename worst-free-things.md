# The Worst Free Things
Everybody loves free stuff. But free stuff is often just a scam, and can even give you a virus. Here are some free things I know are scams.

## Websites
### Domains

.tk, .ga, .cf, .gq and .ml domains: They are free, but expire after a year and you have to pay

### Hosting

000webhost.com and hosting24.com: Hosting is up 60% of the time or less, and 12-year-old PCs run code faster than their servers
