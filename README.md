# The Best Free Things
If you're cheap like me, you want good free stuff. Here's a list of all my favorite good free things.

## Image Editing
###### Bitmap/Raster Graphics
[Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html)

###### Vector Graphics
Inkscape is the best for Vector, hands down.

###### Both at Once
(It's like ambidextrious image editing, except not at all like that.)  
[Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/)
