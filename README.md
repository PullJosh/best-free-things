# The Best Free Things
If you're cheap like me, you want good free stuff. Here's a list of all my favorite good free things.

## Pictures
### Image Editing
Bitmap/Raster Graphics: [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html)

Vector Graphics: [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/)

Both at Once: [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) *(It's like ambidextrious image editing, except not at all like that.)*


### Image Hosting
Clean interface with no ads (no account required): [Cubeupload](http://cubeupload.com/)

Professional-looking host with a few ads (needs account): [Photobucket](http://photobucket.com/)

### Image Taking (screenshots)
In-browser or offline, automatic uploading: [Lightshot](https://app.prntscr.com/)

Offline only, also takes animated GIFs: [Gyazo](https://gyazo.com/) *(NOTE: I gained a virus soon after installing this. However, nobody else has had issues. Most likely safe, but be careful.)*

Windows-only, no automatic upload: [Snipping Tool](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-capture-screen-shots#1TC=windows-8) *(Most likely came with Windows)*

## Text Editing
**(And also spreadsheets, presentations, etc. Basically free Microsoft Office.)**

Full-featured online editor with auto-save, live multi-person editing, and more: [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/) *(Also known as Google Drive. Docs and drive aren't technically the same thing, but they pretty much are. I don't understand either.)*

Offline Editor: [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/)

LaTeX WYSIWYM Editor: [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/) *(Great for math and science)*

## Code Editing

Code for the front-end web (HTML, CSS, JS, etc): [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)

General Code (all languages): [Atom](https://atom.io/) *(Fancy, new editor)*, [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) [(3)](http://www.sublimetext.com/3/) *(Very customizable)* _(NOTE: This will pop up an alert every few hours (that's how frequent it is for me) about maybe you should buy Sublime for $70. This is completely optional._

## Terminal/Command Line Replacements

Windows: [Cmder](http://cmder.net/)

OS X: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
